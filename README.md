[00:26.05] When I met your eyes
[00:29.51] It was like love at first sight
[00:32.64] Your gaze contained
[00:35.34] Sugar, spice, and everything nice
[00:51.84] 
[00:38.27] My heart fluttering
[00:41.70] As I wish for the sweet taste
[00:44.59] A stellar dream
[00:47.50] That was brought together by fate
[01:04.00] 
[00:51.30] So sweet, every little thing you do
[00:54.36] I think I'm falling in love with you
[00:57.25] So, please, I know that this feeling's true
[01:00.30] Tell me, 'cause I know that you feel it too
[01:21.80] 
[01:50.29] When I met your eyes
[01:53.44] It was like love at first sight
[01:56.60] Your gaze contained

[02:16.06] 
[02:02.30] My heart fluttering
[02:05.67] As I wish for the sweet taste

[02:45.71] 
[02:28.23] (3, 2, 1, let's go!)
[02:38.23] 
[02:51.31] So sweet, every little thing you do
